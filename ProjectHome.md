## What is BibApp? ##
The BibApp is a Campus Research Gateway and Expert Finder.

BibApp lets you:

  * find experts and current collaborations happening on your campus
  * promote the research of a department, school, or research group
  * increase the impact of campus research
  * easily reuse publication data

BibApp matches researchers on your campus with their publication data and allows you to mine the data to see collaborations and to find experts in research areas. BibApp makes it easy to see what publications can be archived for greater access and impact and makes it easy to push those publications directly into an institutional or other repository.
