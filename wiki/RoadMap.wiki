  * Bugs to Fix (moved here from Interface Redesign)
    * Books and Book Chapters are not yet displayed properly in !BibApp.  The Book Title always appears as "Unknown".
    * Web Services (extracting data via YAML, XML, JSON, etc.) still is buggy from UW.  It seems to work fine for UIUC however.  We need to figure out why it is not consistently working.
    * ~~Upgrade process from 0.7 to latest code is a bit buggy because of the rename of "Citations" to "Works".  We need to smooth this out, to make it an easy upgrade from 0.7 to 1.0.~~
    * We need to upgrade to the *stable* Solr 1.3.0.  We're still running on a nightly build.
